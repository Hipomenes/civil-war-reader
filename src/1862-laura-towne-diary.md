     After the the Union army occupied the Sea Islands of South Carolina early
     in the war, a small group of Northerners came to the coast to attempt to
     restart cotton cultivation on the islands with wage labor. Laura
     Towne---who was assigned to start a school for freedpeople---accompanied
     these cotton agents and wrote about how freedpeople in the area reacted to
     the new arrangements.

## April 18, 1862 — Friday. 

When I said something to Mr. Pierce about not wishing to interfere with the
system, he answered, " Oh, Miss Towne, we have no systems here."^[Edward Pierce
had been the superintendent of "contraband" slaves at Fortress Monroe until
January 1862, when he was sent to oversee "contrabands" on the Sea Islands.] He
spoke playfully, but I think there is truth in it. The teachers who came down
here with us have not yet got to work and are going about, not knowing their
destination. When we came, Mr. Pierce sent us here to Mrs. Forbes without any
invitation from her and has left us here since without knowing her wishes
about it. She has nothing to do with the Commission and should not be troubled
with its affairs, which makes it uncomfortable for Mr. Philbrick and me.^[Edward Philbrick was the assistant superintendent of the
Boston & Worcester Railroad and one of several Northern investors who sought,
during the Civil War, to set up a model free-labor experiment for growing
cotton in the Sea Islands.] . . . 

There has been a little rebellion upon Mr. Philbrick's plantation (the old
Coffin plantation). Two men, one upon each estate, refuse to work the
four hours a day they are required to give to the cotton, but insist upon
cultivating their own cornpatch only. They threaten, if unprovided with food,
to break into the corn-house.  One man drew his knife upon his driver, but
crouched as soon as Mr. Philbrick laid his hand upon his shoulder. Mr.
Philbrick came to Beaufort and has taken back a corporal and two soldiers to
arrest and guard these men for a few days. The negroes, Mr. Philbrick says, are
docile generally and require the positive ordering that children of five or
ten years of age require, but are far more afraid of any white man than of
their drivers.

The question of to-day is how to dispose of the clothing
to the poor people. They are willing to buy generally, 
but the supply is too small to admit of selling all they 
want. . . . 

They say, "Gov'ment is fighting for us and we will 
work for Gov'ment. We don't ask money; we only ask 
clothes and salt and sweetins." They express the greatest 
love for the Yankees. 

We ladies are borrowed, to go talk to the negroes, from one plantation to
another, and we do good, great good.  If I only had time to tell all they say
to me! Or how they come thronging here for clothes and go away "too
satisfied---too thank," one woman said, at receiving some few
things---generally, too, second-hand---some of it miserable....

The cotton agents promised last year and now are 
just paying for the cotton picked on their promise, one 
dollar in four---the rest in orders on their stores, where 
they sell molasses at fifteen cents a pint and soap and 
salt in proportion. The negroes take it hard that they 
must work at cotton again this year, especially as it 
must be to the neglect of their corn, upon which they have 
the sense to feel that their next winter's food depends. . . .

The blessed soldiers, with all their wrongdoing, did this 
one good thing---they assured the negroes that they 
were free and must never again let their masters claim 
them, nor any masters. I think it is very touching to 
hear them begging Mr. Pierce to let them cultivate corn 
instead of cotton, of which they do not see the use, since 
they worked it last year for pay which has not come yet, 
while their corn has saved them from starvation. Next 
week they are to be paid a dollar an acre for the cotton 
they have planted under Mr. Pierce. They do not understand being paid on account, and they think one dollar 
an acre for ploughing, listing, or furrowing and planting 
is very little, which of course it is. Mr. P. wants to make 
it their interest to tend the cotton after it is planted, 
and so he pays on it just as little as he can, until it is all 
ready for the market. Meanwhile, if the masters drive 
us off, no return will ever be made for their work, to the 
people who are planting for us. Nothing is paid for the 
cultivation of the corn, and yet it will be Government 
property. The negroes are so willing to work on that, that 
Mr. P. has made it a rule that till a certain quantity of 
cotton is planted they shall not hoe the corn. This they 
take as a great hardship, for the corn wants hoeing.  ...

Mr. Pierce takes us to the different plantations as often as he can to talk to
the negroes and make them contented, which they are not now by any means. ...

The negroes are pretty cunning. They pretend they want us to stay, that they
would be in despair if we went away, and they tell us they will give us eggs
and chickens. Indeed, they do constantly offer eggs and they feel hurt if they
are refused, for that is equivalent to refusing to make any returns. Old
Susannah, the cook, often sends to the table fish or other delicacies. When
I ask her where she got them, she says a friend gave them to her and she gives
them to us. She doesn't want pay---no, indeed. She always gave such things to
her old "massas," and then they in return gave a little sweetening or something
good from the house. It was give and take, good feeling all around. All giving
on one side, I should think; all taking, nearly, on the other; and good feeling
according to the nature of the class, one only content in grasping, the other
in giving. They transfer their gratitude to "Government." One woman said to
me, " I was servant-born, ma'am, and now 'cause de Gov'ment fightin' for me,
I'll work for Gov'ment, dat I will, and welcome." Another woman, to-day, just
from "the main," said to me that she had hard work to escape, . sleeping in "de
ma'sh" and hiding all day. She brought away her two little children, and said
her master had just "licked" her eldest son almost to death because he was
suspected of wanting to join the Yankees. "They does it to spite us, ma'am,
'cause you come here. Dey spites us now 'cause de Yankees come." She was grate-
ful to the Yankees for coming, nevertheless, but deplored that the season for
planting cotton was over, because only the cotton-workers were to be paid and
she was suffering for clothes. Another man said, "I craves work, ma'am, if
I gets a little pay, but if we don't gets pay, we don't care — don't care to
work." Natural enough.
