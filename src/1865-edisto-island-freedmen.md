abstract: |
     This document is a letter to a Freedmen's Bureau Commissioner General Oliver
     O. Howard from a committee of recently freed men on Edisto Island, South
     Carolina.  Each member of the committee signed his own name, but the
     petition appears to be in Henry Bram's handwriting. An undated endorsement
     referred the petition to General Howard, "By order of the President," who
     was then Andrew Johnson.

General It Is with painfull Hearts that we the committe address you, we
Have thorougholy considered the order which you wished us to Sighn, we
wish we could do so but cannot feel our rights Safe If we do so,[^1]

[^1]: On October 19, General Howard had telegraphed as follows to Secretary of
War Edwin M. Stanton: "I met several hundred of the colored people of Edisto
island to-day, and did my utmost to reconcile them to the surrender of the
lands to former owners. They will submit, but with evident sorrow, to the
breaking of the promise of General Sherman's order. The greatest aversion is
exhibited to making contracts, and they beg and plead for the privilege of
renting or buying land on the island. My task is a hard one, and I am convinced
that something must be done to give these people and others the prospect of
homesteads." 

General we want Homestead's; we were promised Homestead's by the
government,[^2] If It does not carry out the promises Its agents made to
us, If the government Haveing concluded to befriend Its late enemies and
to neglect to observe the principles of common faith between Its self
and us Its allies In the war you said was over, now takes away from them
all right to the soil they stand upon save such as they can get by again
working for *your* late and thier *all time ememies*.---If the government
does so we are left In a more unpleasant condition than our former

[^2]: The Committee refers here to a promise made by General William
Tecumseh Sherman when he occupied the islands at the beginning of 1865.

we are at the mercy of those who are combined to prevent us from getting
land enough to lay our Fathers bones upon. We Have property In Horses,
cattle, carriages, & articles of furniture, but we are landless and
Homeless, from the Homes we Have lived In In the past we can only do one
of three things Step Into the public *road or the sea* or remain on them
working as In former time and subject to thire will as then. We can not
resist It In any way without being driven out Homeless upon the road.

You will see this Is not the condition of really freemen

You ask us to forgive the land owners of our Island, *You* only lost
your right arm. In war and might forgive them. The man who tied me to a
tree & gave me 39 lashes & who stripped and flogged my mother & my
sister & who will not let me stay In His empty Hut except I will do His
planting & be Satisfied with His price & who combines with others to
keep away land from me well knowing I would not Have any thing to do
with Him If I Had land of my own.---that man, I cannot well forgive. Does
It look as If He Has forgiven me, seeing How He tries to keep me In a
condition of Helplessness

General, we cannot remain Here In such condition and If the government
permits them to come back we ask It to Help us to reach land where we
shall not be slaves nor compelled to work for those who would treat us
as such

we Have not been treacherous, we Have not for selfish motives allied to
us those who suffered like us from a common enemy & then Haveing gained
*our* purpose left our allies In thier Hands There Is no rights secured
to us there Is no law likely to be made which our Hands can reach. The
state will make laws that we shall not be able to Hold land even If we
pay for It Landless, Homeless. Voteless. we can only pray to god & Hope
for *His Help*, *your Infuence & assistance* With consideration of
esteem your Obt Servts \
 In behalf of the people

Charleston. S.C. Oct 22, 1865.

Messrs. I have just received your letter. You are right *in wanting
homesteads* and will *surely be defended in the possession of ev*ery one
which you shall purchase or have already purchased. The Government does
not wish to befriend its enemies and injure its friends, but considers a
forgiven man in the light of a citizen restored to rights of property
excepting as to slaves. The Supervisory Board must not permit what you
fear. The old master would be very foolish to try a system of
oppression as it would ruin them forever now that you are free. If the
planters combine as you think, they will soon be able to get no labor.
Their whipping post of which you complain is abolished forever. The duty
of forgiveness is plain and simple. Forgive as we hope to be forgiven of
Him who governs all things.

Congress must meet before any public lands can be had and before I can
buy any for you. I will ask for your rights and try to obtain them. A
contract may be by a lease as well as for wages, So that I do not think
the Planters will object to leasing you land. Some can lease, some can
buy and some can work for wages. I advise the sending to you of Northern
men for Agents of the owners where true men can be found.

I think the people had better enter into contracts, leasing or for wages
or purchase when possible for next year. If it dont work well something
else may be tried afterwards. Send your petition to Congress, if you
wish, and I will see that it is not passed by without proper attention.
The President himself will urge something in your behalf. Very Truly
Yours

O. O. Howard

Edisto Island S.C. Oct 28^th^ 1865.

We the freedmen Of Edisto Island South Carolina have learned From you
through Major General O O Howard commissioner of the Freedmans Bureau.
with deep sorrow and Painful hearts of the possibility of goverment
restoring These lands to the former owners. We are well aware Of the
many perplexing and trying questions that burden Your mind. and do
therefore pray to god (the preserver Of all. and who has through our
Late and beloved President (Lincoln) proclamation and the war made Us A
free people) that he may guide you in making Your decisions. and give
you that wisdom that Cometh from above to settle these great and
Important Questions for the best interests of the country and the
Colored race: Here is where secession was born and Nurtured Here is were
we have toiled nearly all Our lives as slaves and were treated like dumb
Driven cattle, This is our home, we have made These lands what they are.
we were the only true and Loyal people that were found in posession of
these Lands. we have been always ready to strike for Liberty and
humanity yea to fight if needs be To preserve this glorious union. Shall
not we who Are freedman and have been always true to this Union have the
same rights as are enjoyed by Others? Have we broken any Law of these
United States? Have we forfieted our rights of property In Land?--- If not
then! are not our rights as A free people and good citizens of these
United States To be considered before the rights of those who were Found
in rebellion against this good and just Goverment (and now being
conquered) come (as they Seem) with penitent hearts and beg forgiveness
For past offences and also ask if thier lands Cannot be restored to them
are these rebellious Spirits to be reinstated in thier *possessions* And
we who have been abused and oppressed For many long years not to be
allowed the Privilige of purchasing land But be subject To the will of
these large Land owners? God fobid, Land monopoly is injurious to the
advancement of the course of freedom, and if government Does not make
some provision by which we as Freedmen can obtain A Homestead, we have
Not bettered our condition.

We have been encouraged by government to take up these lands in small
tracts, receiving Certificates of the same--- we have thus far Taken
Sixteen thousand (16000) acres of Land here on This Island. We are ready
to pay for this land When Government calls for it. and now after What
has been done will the good and just government take from us all this
right and make us Subject to the will of those who have cheated and
Oppressed us for many years God Forbid! We the freedmen of this Island
and of the State of South Carolina---Do therefore petition to you as the
President of these United States, that some provisions be made by which
Every colored man can purchase land. and Hold it as his own. We wish to
have A home if It be but A few acres. without some provision is Made our
future is sad to look upon. yes our Situation is dangerous. we therefore
look to you In this trying hour as A true friend of the poor and
Neglected race. for protection and Equal Rights. with the privilege of
purchasing A Homestead---A Homestead right here in the Heart of South
Carolina.

We pray that god will direct your heart in Making such provision for us
as freedmen which Will tend to unite these states together stronger Than
ever before--- May God bless you in the Administration of your duties as
the President Of these United States is the humble prayer Of us all.---
