I am not here to fan the flame of sectional animosity, to revive old
issues, or to stir up strife between races; but no candid man, looking
at the political situation of the hour, can fail to see that we are
still afflicted by the painful sequences both of slavery and of the late
rebellion. In the spirit of the noble man whose image now looks down
upon us we should have "charity toward all, and malice toward
none."^[This speech was delivered near a [statue of Abraham Lincoln][]
that stood in Union Square in New York City.] In the language of our
greatest soldier, twice honored with the Presidency of the nation, "Let
us have peace."^[The speaker refers to Ulysses S. Grant.] Yes, let us
have peace, but let us have liberty, law, and justice first. Let us have
the Constitution, with its thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
amendments, fairly interpreted, faithfully executed, and cheerfully
obeyed in the fullness of their spirit and the completeness of their
letter. Men can do many things in this world, some easily and some with
difficulty; but here are some things which men cannot do or be. When
they are here they cannot be there. When the supreme law of the land is
systematically set at naught; when humanity is insulted and the rights
of the weak are trampled in the dust by a lawless power; when society is
divided into two classes, as oppressed and oppressor, there is no power,
and there can be no power, while the instincts of manhood remain as they
are, which can provide solid peace. [...]

Good, wise, and generous men at the North, in power and out of power,
for whose good intentions and patriotism we must all have the highest
respect, doubt the wisdom of observing this memorial day, and would have
us forget and forgive, strew flowers alike and lovingly, on rebel and on
loyal graves. This sentiment is noble and generous, worthy of all honor
as such; but it is only a sentiment after all, and must submit to its
own rational limitations. There was a right side and a wrong side in the
late war, which no sentiment ought to cause us to forget, and while
to-day we should have malice toward none, and charity toward all, it is
no part of our duty to confound right with wrong, or loyalty with
treason. If the observance of this memorial day has any apology, office,
or significance, it is derived from the moral character of the war, from
the far-reaching, unchangeable, and eternal principles in dispute, and
for which our sons and brothers encountered hardship, danger, and death.
